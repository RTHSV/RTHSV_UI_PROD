                        <h2>Welcome To <span>RAMSHETH THAKUR HIGHER SECONDARY VIDYALAYA</span></h2>
                        <p>Ramsheth Thakur Higher Secondary Vidyalaya, Kharghar (Eng.Medium) was initiated
                            by J.B.S.P. Sanstha In June 2014. The institution aims to provide quality education for the
                            allround
                            holistic development of the student. The first batch of std XII had appeared independently
                            for the Higher Secondary examination in the year 2015-16. The institution organizes several
                            curricular and co-curricular activities for preparing students to face the challenges of
                            Competitive
                            world.</p>
                        <p>A visionary and an educationist with social commitment. Honorable Janardan Bhagat
                            dreamt of a just social order where quality education is made available to the deprived
                            section of
                            the society. It was his dream that was brought into reality by his trusted lieutenants in
                            establishing
                            Janardan Bhagat Shikshan Prasarak Sanstha in 1992.</p>
                        <p>A seed was sown in Gavan in 1992 for the first educational institution of Janaradan Bhagat
                            Shikshan Prasarak Sanstha. In 1994 Sanstha opened it's two more schools i.e. Changu Kana
                            Thakur Vidyalaya, Marathi & English Medium at New Panvel. The Sanstha is on its sacred march
                            of adding more educational institutions. In 1997 with permission from the Govt. of
                            Maharashtra,
                            Sanstha established its CKT Arts, Commerce & Science Degree College affiliated to the
                            University of Mumbai. Now a days JBSP Sanstha is running 19 institutes in this area.</p>
