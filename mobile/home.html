                            allround
                            holistic development of the student. The first batch of std XII had appeared independently

                            dreamt of a just social order where quality education is made available to the deprived
                            section of
                            the society. It was his dream that was brought into reality by his trusted lieutenants in
                            establishing
                            Janardan Bhagat Shikshan Prasarak Sanstha in 1992.</p>
                        <p>A seed was sown in Gavan in 1992 for the first educational institution of Janaradan Bhagat
                            Shikshan Prasarak Sanstha. In 1994 Sanstha opened it's two more schools i.e. Changu Kana
                            Thakur Vidyalaya, Marathi & English Medium at New Panvel. The Sanstha is on its sacred march
                            of adding more educational institutions. In 1997 with permission from the Govt. of

                            University of Mumbai. Now a days JBSP Sanstha is running 19 institutes in this area.</p>
